# ==============================================================================
# Bash script to run image generation with a range of temperature values
# across multiple prompt collections.
#
# This script will loop through each specified prompt file. For each file,
# it will generate a new random seed and then perform a full temperature sweep.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Required Python packages are installed (torch, torchvision, etc.).
# 2. Pre-trained models are located in the './pretrained_models/' directory.
# 3. Prompt files ('conceptual.txt', 'coco_captions.txt') exist.
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# Add all your prompt collections to this array
PROMPT_FILES=("conceptual.txt" "coco_captions.txt")

# Temperature sweep settings
START_TEMP=0.1
END_TEMP=1.0
STEP_TEMP=0.1

# Other settings
BATCH_SIZE=16           # Adjust based on your VRAM
